# single-page-web-app-bootstrap-skeleton
This repo is a skeleton/ template for easy initial creation of single page web apps that will use Bootstrap, the CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. Files are customizeable; users can change features like fonts, icons, animations, and overall styling, just to name a few. 

Clone this repo if you are a freelancer looking to streamline the initial format and build process of a single page web application using Bootstrap or a small business owner who had dabbled in html, css, and javascript and wants to get a quick single page app up and running to communicate with customers.
